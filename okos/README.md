#OKOS by abakos

_(unfinished / work-in-progress)_

**OKOS** is a toy project.
OKOS stands for **Online Keyboard On Screen**.
Also, it means *smart* in Hungarian.

Use your keyboard for typing. When you press a button you should see it in action on the screen too.
Although there are some limitations:
- OKOS does not support mouse clicks just yet, event though it has working hover effect built-in
- It was designed with a UK keyboard in mind, so the arrangement of the keys can obviously be slightly vary with different keyboards
- Some buttons that are not hooked up with jQuery shown as opaque

When the idea conceived first, the main purpose was to create detailed and credible keyboard buttons only by CSS and to mimic a real keyboard and its key movements. It was intended to be a realistic digital representation of its appropriate physical counterpart designed only with codes, therefore no external graphic elements have been used throughout the experiment.

Maybe, hopefully OKOS will come handy for someone at some point.

Just for fun.
