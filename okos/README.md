#OKOS by abakos

**OKOS** is a toy project.
OKOS stands for **Online Keyboard On Screen**.
Also, it means *smart* in Hungarian.

Use your keyboard for typing. When you press a button you should see it in action on the screen too. OKOS does not support mouse clicks yet.

When the idea conceived first, its main purpose was to mimic a real keyboard and its key movement. It was intended to be a realistic digital representation of its appropriate physical counterpart - the keyboard - designed only with CSS codes.

Maybe someday OKOS will come handy for someone...

Just for fun.
